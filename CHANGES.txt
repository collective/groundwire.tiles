Changelog
=========

1.0 (unreleased)
----------------

* Tiles must now set the X-Tile-Editable response header to 1 to make
  an editable border be shown for the tile. The included sample tiles
  set it based on the 'Modify portal content' permission for the tile's
  context (which is a change from before, when the same permission was
  checked in the context where the tile was being included).
